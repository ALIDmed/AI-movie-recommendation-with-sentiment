Movie Whisper is a web app that provides movie recommendations using AI-based content-based filtering, specifically cosine similarity, and sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The application is built with React (using Vite as the development environment) and tailwind for the front-end, and it relies on a Flask API for the back-end.
**You can run the app online using [this link](https://zaraki000.github.io/vite-deploy/).**

```

6. That's it üòÅ


## How recommendation works?

Cosine similarity is a method when used in movie recommendation systems to measure the similarity between movies based on their features. Each movie is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, with each feature contributing to its position in the space. Cosine similarity calculates how similar two movies are by measuring the cosine of the angle between their feature vectors. Movies with a higher cosine similarity are considered more similar and are recommended to users who have previously liked or interacted with similar movies. This helps in providing personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie features.
